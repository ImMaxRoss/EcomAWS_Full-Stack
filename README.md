# Capstone Assignment: Next Big Idea Development
Company X is a conglomerate, which means they are made up of many different businesses. They have dipped their toes in creating all types of products and services, but are looking to invest in their next big idea.

You are tasked to come up with this new application that can be marketed by Company X. They donâ€™t mind any idea you come up with, but the application should be able to maintain a set of users in some way.

The final application should showcase all the main functionalities you expect of
your idea.

While deciding on what type of product you will build, make sure you can answer the
following questions:

1. What does the application do?
2. Who is the target audience for this application?
3. How is it useful?

## Requirements

The Full-Stack Application you build must have:
1. Frontend created using Angular
    - Utilize the Angular's built-in Router
    - Should consume the APIs you built
2. Maintain a set of users that can login to whatever application you build
3. Backend Service using Java Spring Boot
    - Must use JPA with a MySQL database
    - Include at least one Validation annotation
    - At least one custom query (using naming rules or @Query)
    - Have at least one custom exception and contain a Global Exception Handler
    - Set up testing with Mockito & JUnit for your APIs
    - Utilize Postman to test the API's along the way (TDD)
    - Add in Swagger documentation
    - Set up security using JWTs
4. Deploy your project fully on AWS

## Backlog

### Backend Testing with Postman

#### 1. **Create a Postman Collection**
   - Set up Postman collection to organize API requests.

#### 2. **Define API Request Tests**
   - **Authentication API Tests**
     - Create requests to test login and logout endpoints.
     - Validate correct user credentials and error responses for invalid inputs.
   - **CRUD Operations**
     - Set up requests to validate CRUD operations for core entities.
     - Check for correct HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, etc.) and response body content.

#### 3. **Implement Automated Testing**
   - Use Postman's built-in test scripts to automate response validation.

#### 4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Define variables for dynamic data such as authorization tokens
   - Use Postman Pre-request scripts to dynamically set values required for requests.

#### 5. **Chain Requests for End-to-End Testing**
   - Create request chains to simulate user interactions.

#### 6. **Debug and Refine Tests**

   - **Amazon CloudFront**
     - Set up CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket as the origin.
     - Configure caching and SSL/TLS settings for security and performance.

#### 2. **Deploy Frontend Logic on EC2**
   - Launch an EC2 instance for running the Angular application logic.
   - Configure security groups for access through CloudFront.
   - Deploy the Angular application using a suitable web server (e.g., NGINX).

#### 3. **Load Balancing with Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
   - Establish an ALB to handle user HTTP/S requests.
   - Target the backend EC2 instances for incoming traffic.
   - Configure health checks and rules for routing traffic efficiently.

#### 4. **Backend Deployment and Database Configuration**
   - **Amazon EC2 for Spring Boot Application**
     - Launch EC2 instances to host your Spring Boot backend.
     - Configure the environment by installing necessary software (JRE, web server).
     - Deploy the Spring Boot application.

   - **Amazon RDS**
     - Set up an RDS instance for managing your database.
     - Configure security groups to allow connections from backend EC2 instances.

#### 5. **Content Distribution and Frontend Integration**
